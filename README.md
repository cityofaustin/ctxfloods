## Set Up Development Environment
üíæ [Install yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

üëØ Clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/cityofaustin/ctxfloods
cd ctxfloods
yarn install
```

‚å®Ô∏è Start the local server
```
yarn start-local
```

üíæ Clone and install [CTXFloods-backend](https://github.com/cityofaustin/ctxfloods-backend)

ü•Ç Cheers! The frontend should now be up and running! Have fun clicking around!

## Run Tests
```
yarn test
```
If any storybook snapshots need updating, run `yarn test -u`

## Run Storybook

## Deployment Process
Branch promotion works like this:<br>
feature -> dev -> master

Create your feature branch as a branch off "dev". That feature branch will be merged into "dev", which will then be merged into "master."

CTXFloods uses TravisCI for continuous integration. Whenever you push to github, a TravisCI build will be triggered. By default this will only run the tests. If you want to deploy your feature branch on a git push, add the name of your feature branch to `deployment/devDeployConfig` with the option `deploy: true`. This will build a new S3 Bucket for your feature branch frontend. Subsequent pushes from the same branch will update this same bucket. If you want to connect it to a specific backend deployment, add the name of the backend branch under the `backend` option. Ex:
```
"195-camera": {
  deploy: true,
  backend: "195-camera"
}
```
If `deploy: true` is set without a specified backend, your frontend will point to the "dev" branch backend.

Environment variables are sourced from `deployment/vars` depending on your branch. (All feature branches share the same environment variables as `dev.sh`. Any feature branch specific configs should be handled in `deployment/devDeployConfig.js`.) Any environment variable prefixed with `TRAVIS_` is a secret environment variable that is stored in TravisCI. It will get loaded in during the build phase of a TravisCI/github deployment.

It would be possible to deploy ctxfloods without continuous integration by running `deployment/deploy.sh`. However, you would have to provide your own substitutes for the `TRAVIS_` environment variables.

## Development Tips
+ üîë Some pages require a login:

   <img src="/README/login-to-frontend.png" align="middle" height="300" >

   üìß In case of such a page, you can log in as the default super admin user:
   * Email: superadmin@flo.ods
   * Password: texasfloods

   This password is set as `PG_SUPER_ADMIN_PW` in `/deployment/vars/local` in ctxfloods-**backend**.
+ Every route that is prefixed by `/dashboard` is a route that requires authentication. To get to the login page, manually enter the URL address `localhost:3000/dashboard/map`. After authentication succeeds, you will be redirected to the authenticated `/map` page. To log off (i.e. remove you jwt_user_token from local storage), click "Sign out" in the upper right hand corner of the header and manually enter `localhost:3000/map`.
+ If you added a new postgres migration file to the backend, regenerate the frontend's graphql schema file by running `yarn get-schema`
