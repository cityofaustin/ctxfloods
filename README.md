🏗 Your build should appear on [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/)

### Test the deployed frontend
//TODO Automate this
* Go to [S3](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/) and find your bucket (it should be ctxfloods-frontend-***your branch name***)
* Go to Properties -> Static Website Hosting
  * Select **Use this bucket to host a website**
    * Set **index.html** as both the Index and Error document (react-router will be doing our error handling)

🍾 Cheers! You should now have a deployed instance up and running.
