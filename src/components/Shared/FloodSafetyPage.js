      <h2>Avoid dangerous situations</h2>

      <p>
        Itâ€™s easy to underestimate how dangerous conditions can get and how quickly they can get that way.
        To stay safe, take these steps:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Avoid driving.</li>

        <li>Be alert to your surroundings.</li>

        <li>Monitor local media.</li>

        <li>Avoid driving.</li>

        <li>
          Stay away from creeks, trails, culverts, ponds, and other drainage
          infrastructure.
        </li>

        <li>
          If water starts to rise, seek higher ground. This may mean getting on
          your roof.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>If you must drive...</h2>

      <p>
        About 75% of flood-related deaths in Texas occur in vehicles. Especially at night,
        heavy rain can make it difficult to see that a road is flooded.
        All flooded roads will not be barricaded. Survivors have told us that they did not
        even see water on the road until their vehicle had stalled.

      </p>

      <p>
        If you cannot avoid being on the roads when there is a risk of flash flooding:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Check <a href="http://www.atxfloods.com/">atxfloods.com</a> for known, flooded roads.
        </li>

        <li>Avoid low water crossings.</li>

        <li>Actively look for water over the road.</li>

        <li>
          Turn around if a road is barricaded or if water is over the road. Keep
          in mind that the road may be heavily damaged underneath the flood
          water.
        </li>
      </ul>
