      <h1>Flood Safety</h1>
      <p>
        Austin lies in the heart of Flash Flood Alley, and it is critical that
        you be alert to the dangers of flooding both in your home and on the
        road.
      </p>

      <h2>Save yourself!</h2>

      <p>
        Rushing water has tremendous power. Taking the following steps during a
        storm can help you stay safe:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Be alert to your surroundings.</li>

        <li>Monitor local media.</li>

        <li>Avoid driving.</li>

        <li>
          Stay away from creeks, trails, culverts, ponds, and other drainage
          infrastructure.
        </li>

        <li>
          If water starts to rise, seek higher ground. This may mean getting on
          your roof.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>If you must drive...</h2>

      <p>
        About 75% of flood-related deaths in Texas occur in vehicles. At night,
        during heavy storms, it may be difficult to see that a road is flooded.
        Survivors have told us that they did not even see water on the road
        until their vehicle stalled in it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Realizing that not all flooded roads will be barricaded, take the
        following precautions:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Check
          <a href="http://www.atxfloods.com/">ATXfloods.com</a>
           for known, flooded roads.
        </li>

        <li>Avoid low water crossings.</li>

        <li>Actively look for water over the road.</li>

        <li>
          Turn around if a road is barricaded or if water is over the road. Keep
          in mind that the road may be heavily damaged underneath the flood
          water.
        </li>
      </ul>
